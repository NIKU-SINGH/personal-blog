Confused as to what to give the title of the blog hence Confused so am I. I have been wanting to write this blog for a while, wanted to share what I am feeling.
Soon I am  going to be 24 but it doesn’t feel like that. Growing up I felt ki 24 25 year old would have felt different seeing grownups when I was young I wanted to be at that age. But now when I am here at this age, still confused don’t know what to do, seems like days are just going by.
