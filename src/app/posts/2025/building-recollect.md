Hi everyone my Name is Niku Singh, so this is going to be the first blog in the series about building recollect.

**What is recollect?**

Recollect is a smart centralized bookmarking hub that organizes, categorizes, and enhances your saved content for seamless access and discovery. A more detailed description can be found in my [Figma Deck](https://www.figma.com/slides/E3n9v2zEsnnGMUdMZvIL5K/Recollect-Template-1?node-id=11-111&t=b4U4Uyw5HfqooxxQ-1)

**Motivation behind the idea**

The main reason why I am building is that because I felt the need for it.
I often save posts, links, and websites with the intention of revisiting them later, only to forget where I saved them. The same goes for marking videos as "Watch Later" and bookmarking postsâ€”most of them just end up untouched.
Often these saved contents have some sort of connection between them

Like i have saved ai related resources on Twitter, reddit, linkedin posts and YouTube.

And when I need to find those saved resources, I have to search through bookmarks on each platform individuallyâ€”only to realize how difficult it is to track them down.

I have been tinkering on this idea for a while now, I have researched over internet talked to friends.
Seems like this problem is genuine and there are some notable companies already working on this idea.
Some of them are really good like

[My Mind](https://mymind.com/), [Pack Pack AI](https://packpack.ai/), [Clipmate AI](https://clipmate.ai/), [Supermemory AI](https://supermemory.ai/), [Are.na](https://are.na/)

Some might ask, why reinvent the wheel when so many tools already exist? My answer is simple:

1. I want to build it and learn in the process.
2. Thereâ€™s a unique satisfaction in bringing my own idea to life.
3. Existing tools lack certain features that I personally want to create.

**What I have in Mind?**

_After working on this project on and off for a long time, I finally built an MVP! ðŸŽ‰_

It's a simple web app with a Chrome extensionâ€”just click on a post to save it, and it gets stored on our platform. You can also categorize your saved posts and leverage AI-powered search for easy retrieval.

**Working Demo**

[Watch the demo video on Loom](https://www.loom.com/embed/e03d17fe58f843af9fbb77395a2490c1?sid=0547f189-3f7e-4534-aaa7-5fa8ab8fa84e)

**Learnings**

Building this demo was a great learning experience! I got hands-on with Chrome extensions, web scraping, Postgres, and Supabase. Iâ€™ll be sharing my insights in upcoming blogs, but overall, it was a fun and rewarding journey.

**Whats Next**

My next thing is to:

- Make the ui better and launch the product
- Work on integrating it with other platform
- Add auto imports for bookmarks
- Refine the search to give responses better
